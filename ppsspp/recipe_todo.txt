# PPSSPP BIOS
    log i "Downloading PPSSPP BIOS..." "$logfile"
    wget "https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" -O "$WORK_DIR/ppsspp-bios.zip"
    unzip -o "$WORK_DIR/ppsspp-bios.zip" -d "$WORK_DIR/ppsspp-bios"
    mkdir -p "$component/artifacts/ppsspp-bios/"
    cp -rf "$WORK_DIR/ppsspp-bios/ppsspp-master/assets/PPSSPP"/* "$component/artifacts/ppsspp-bios/"
