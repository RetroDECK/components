The Libsolarus version number must always match the current release version.  
When a new release is published, the version must be updated accordingly in the recipe to ensure consistency between the packaged library and the official release.

Example recipe entry for version v.2.0.3:

{
  "library": "libsolarus.so.2.0.3",
  "source": "usr/lib",
  "dest": "shared-libs"
}

Naming convention:
libsolarus.so.<version>
