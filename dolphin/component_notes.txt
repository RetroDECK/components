This component appears to have a static path coded for its assets. The current workaround appears to be to create this symlink in the core RetroDECK flatpak:

ln -s "/app/retrodeck/components/dolphin/share/dolphin-emu" "/app/share/dolphin-emu"

This workaround was added to the finalization module of the RetroDECK manifest
