Same error as dosbox-x

Added libc but and the error went away, but It might need a specific version as it does not launch.

/app/retrodeck/components/dosbox-x/bin/dosbox-x: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.42' not found (required by /app/retrodeck/components/dosbox-x/bin/dosbox-x)

It's also complaning about it can't find:

        {
          "library": "libslirp.so.0",
          "source": "lib",
          "dest": "shared-libs"
        },

But it is the repo
