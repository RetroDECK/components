Ikeman‑go doesn’t require a launcher.

All that’s needed are the recipe, prepare, and the manifest containing the metadata that we ship with the system.

Ikeman‑go isn’t executed directly for games. Instead, the binary must be placed (and renamed) in each fan‑made game under mugen/game.mugen/ as game.mugen.

Future enhancement: expose the ikeman-go directory at storage/ikeman-go. This would let users copy the specific files they need from that location into their own game folders.

Because each game has its own set of required files, the exact contents will vary from one title to another (M.U.G.E.N vs Ikeman).
