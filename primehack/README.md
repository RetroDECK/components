# Primehack

This version of Primehack is a fork created by RetroDECK, which addresses the issue of overwriting Dolphin's directories due to naming conflicts with the original Primehack. Although the problem has been reportedly fixed in a pull request (see [here](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiiion.primehack/pull/15)), it still persists when using the official Flatpak as the source. Additionally, an issue opened by Xargon of RetroDECK regarding this matter remains unresolved (see [here](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiiion.primehack/issues/8)).

Primehack is updated infrequently; accordingly, RetroDECK uses a release close to the latest upstream that is stable and sufficient for our scope.
