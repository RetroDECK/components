This component appears to have a static path coded for its assets. The current workaround appears to be to create this symlink in the core RetroDECK flatpak:

ln -s "/app/retrodeck/components/vita3k/share/Vita3K" "/app/share/Vita3K"

If this path can be modified through the component_launcher.sh at some point, it should be handled that way.
