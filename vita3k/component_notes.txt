This component appears to have a static path coded for its assets. The current workaround appears to be to create this symlink in the core RetroDECK flatpak:

ln -s "/app/retrodeck/components/vita3k/share/Vita3K" "/app/share/Vita3K"

If this path can be modified through the component_launcher.sh at some point, it should be handled that way.

This components upstream sources do not keep releases indefinitely, and older versions will drop off quickly. It needs to be updated more often than others to avoid version resolution errors.
